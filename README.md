# Fish Swarm Dynamics

## Abstract
This project aims at understanding the phenomenon of swarming in organisms like fishes which tend to show collective behaviour. It tries to model and understand different rules that govern the local behaviour of the organisms which in turn lead to a collective behaviour on the whole.

## The Vicsek Model
The fishes(boids) simply follow just one rule.
At each time step, a given fish(boid) driven with a constant absolute velocity assumes the average direction of motion of fishes(boids) in its neighborhood of radius r with some random perturbation added which is drawn from a uniform distribution ranging from -eta/2 to eta/2.
